Alias helps us to name the columns which we create by joining available columns.

Typical format :

SELECT 
   [column_1 | expression] AS descriptive_name
FROM table_name;

If descriptive name contains space then,

SELECT 
   [column_1 | expression] AS `descriptive name`
FROM 
   table_name;

For e.g.,

Below statement will conactinate last name and full name using CONCAT_WS method.
And the new data will be displayed in 'FullName' coulmn:

*******************************************************************

SELECT 
    CONCAT_WS(', ', lastName, firstname) as FullName
FROM
    employees;

The below command has space in new column name as "Full Name"

SELECT 
    CONCAT_WS(', ', lastName, firstname) as 'Full Name'
FROM
    employees;


Similarly you can give alias to table name also:

*******************************************************************

SELECT 
    e.firstName, 
    e.lastName
FROM
    employees e
ORDER BY e.firstName;
