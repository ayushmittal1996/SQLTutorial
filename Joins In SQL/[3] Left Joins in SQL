A left join also requires a join-predicate. When joining two tables using a left join, 
the concepts of left and right tables are introduced.

For each row in the left table, the left join compares with every row in the right table as below:

1. If the values in the two rows cause the join condition evaluates to true, 
        then the left join creates a new row whose columns contain all columns of the rows in both tables and includes this row in the result set.

2. If the values in the two rows are not matched, the left join clause still creates a new row such as 
        a. available values for columns of the rows in the left table.
        b. NULL for columns of the row in the right tablle.

Typical format:

SELECT column_list 
FROM table_1 
LEFT JOIN table_2 ON join_condition;

If selected columns for comparison are same then USING keyword can be used:

SELECT column_list 
FROM table_1 
LEFT JOIN table_2 USING (column_name);
