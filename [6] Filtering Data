There are multiple keywords to use for filtering data.

Let's start with WHERE clause:

Command :

SELECT 
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
WHERE
    search_condition;
    
For example:

SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    jobtitle
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    jobtitle = 'Sales Rep';
    
The above command will display 'lasname', 'firstname' and 'jobtitle' from 'employees' table if jobtitle = 'Sales Rep' for that row(data).

Some Keyword which work with WHERE clause:

************************************  1. AND : 

--> To add multiple conditions, we can use AND keyword in following way:
WHERE
    jobtitle = 'Sales Rep' AND 
    officeCode = 1;

************************************  2. OR : 

--> We can use OR keyword if we want all rows which are true of condition A or B or Both as:

--> To add multiple conditions, we can use AND keyword in following way:
WHERE
    jobtitle = 'Sales Rep' OR 
    officeCode = 1;

************************************  3. BETWEEN :

-->The BETWEEN operator returns TRUE if a value is in a range of values:

WHERE
    officeCode BETWEEN 1 AND 3

This will select those rows which have office code between 1 and 3 (both including)

************************************  4. LIKE :

--> LIKE keyword can be used to filter on the basis of pattern, for eg:

WHERE
    lastName LIKE '%son'

We can use '&' and '_' as follows:
% - Any string of 0 or more characters
_ - Any single character

So, following are some example:

%son - Any string ending with son like, myson, tyson, boson. But, sonu will not be selected
son_ - Any string which has son with one more character like, sons, sonu, soni. But, son or rson will not belong to this pattern.

************************************  5. IN :

--> IN keyword helps in finding out rows based on a list of values:

WHERE
    officeCode IN (1 , 3, 4, 7)
    
Above filter will give rows which have office code either 1, 3, 4 or 7

************************************  6. IS NULL : 

--> IS NULL keyword can be used to find out those which does not have any value assigned.
Note : It is not as same as 0. NULL are those spaces in database which have not assigned any value.

SELECT 
    lastName, 
    firstName, 
    reportsTo
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    reportsTo IS NULL;
    
Above filter will give those results for which employee's reportsTo colums is empty.

7. Comparision Operators:

We can use following comparision operators with WHERE clause:

 '=', '!=' or <>, '<', '>', '<=', '>='

Note : '!=' and <> both means NOT_EQUAL_TO

************************************  7. LIMIT:

LIMIT keword is used to limit the number of rows.
It is being used to get the information of how the data has been stored in Table.
Also, it can be used to get specified number of rows.

SELECT 
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
LIMIT [offset,] row_count;

In here, 
offset - It is the row number from where first row need to be picked. First rows is 0th.
row_count - It is the total number of rows need to be displayed.

Note : offset is not mandatory paramter.

Let's take following example:
LIMIT 5 - Will display first 5 rows
LIMIT 2, 5 - Will display 5 rows starting from 3rd row.
LIMIT 0, 5 - Will display 5 rows starting from 0th row. Same as LIMIT 5
