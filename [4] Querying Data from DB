--> SELECT query:
Syntax : select <select_list> from <table_name>

If you want to fetch all the columns then use "*" for <select_list> like:
select * from <table_name>

Note : Use * only if you wnat to see ad-hoc data.

One should not use * in code for the following reasons:
1. It makes query heavy and may load unnecessary data.
2. If in future, tables gets updated, you will end up having different query result.

So, always mention coulumn names in query, if required mention all of them.
