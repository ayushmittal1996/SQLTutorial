Why Joins:

For example, in the sample database, we have the ORDERS and  ORDERDETAILS tables that are linked using the ORDERNUMBER column:

To get complete ORDERSâ€™ information, you need to query data from both ORDERS and  ORDERDETAILS tables.

There are 4 type of Joins in SQL:

1. Inner join
2. Left join
3. Right join
4. Cross join
